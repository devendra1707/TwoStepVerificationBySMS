# TwoStepVerificationBySMS
 In this project we will be enabling our project to send OTP through SMS and verify the User on the basis of that OTP 

 1. We will enable to User to Input a Mobile No on which the OTP is to be sent by providing a Input field to UI using HTML .
 
 2. Then by Using Twilio API's we will send OTP to the User on the No which is been given by User while Registering .
 
 3. We will verify the OTP that , the OPT entered by USER after LOGIN is same as genereated and sent on the Mobile Number .
 
 This is How we are achieving TwoStepverification .
